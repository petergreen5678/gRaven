Title: Bayes nets: 'RHugin' emulation with 'gRain'
Version: 1.0.9

Description: Wrappers for functions in the gRain package to emulate some RHugin 
  functionality, allowing the building of Bayesian networks incrementally, through
  adding nodes, edges and conditional probability tables, the setting of evidence, 
  both 'hard' (boolean) or 'soft' (likelihoods), and querying marginal probabilities
  and normalizing constants. The author is grateful to Therese Graversen for her contributions, 
  especially the function map.configurations, and to Soren Hojsgaard for enhancements 
  to his gRain package that improve the performance of this package..
