# gRaven-devel
Wrappers for functions in the gRain package to emulate some RHugin functionality, allowing the building of Bayesian networks incrementally, through adding nodes, edges and conditional probability tables, the setting of evidence, both 'hard' (boolean) or 'soft' (likelihoods), and querying marginal probabilities and normalizing constants. I am grateful to Søren Højsgaard for enhancements to his gRain package that improve the performance of this package.
To install, type remotes::install_github("petergreen5678/gRaven")
